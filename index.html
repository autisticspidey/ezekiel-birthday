    <h2>ONE YEAR AGO…</h1>
    <p>
      The universe came upon the 26th anniversary of life’s tiniest
      garbanzo bean blessing the world with his/her/their/xyr
      existence. Not only is this the teensiest tiniest itty bitty
      garbanzo bean to ever garbanzo bean, they are also the
      sweetest and prettiest and mostest cleverest and—
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see,
      they are overflowing in magnificence and the universe
      decided that they deserved an incredible gift befitting of such an
      incredible princess garbanzo bean.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, two days after Princess Ezekiel’s birthday,
      the universe delivered life’s silliest goofball to Southern
      California! Within just a mere seven days, everything was set into motion…

    <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
  </section>

  <section class="texts">
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">Ahhhh I got excited about sharing a "graphic novel" I found recently called: "My Shadow Is Purple" by "Scott Stuart".
    Have you heard about it?</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">It's a children's book about nonbinary gender and I swear I cried a good ugly cry the first
      time I read it.</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">!!!! Nonbinary graphic novel rec!!!! Thank you!! I haven’t had a chance to read it yet but I have heard of it, I’m
    always trying to find representation for my nibling (they’re 10 & yearning for they/them content) so I’m peripherally
    aware of most gender books but haven’t had the chance to get through them all yet. I’ll check it out at the library this
    week!</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">Honestly children’s books dealing w gender can hit SO hard and in a very good healing way for your inner child, I have
    ugly cried over a few too :]</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">Is it more fun to be a magician or the Easter bunny?</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">I think maybe graphic novel might be the wrong category to place it in upon further consideration, it's more like a
    children's story with pictures. But I loved it to death. My brother is 10 and would probably respectfully sit with me if
    I tried to read it to him, but also would rather play smash bros or run in a circle aimlessly.

    Easter bunny was cool because there's something inspiring confidence about being in a full costume entertainment
    position. Like eyes are on you, but not on you? Kids react with joy, and I can do silly mascot-like behaviors and be
    praised without feeling the performance anxiety. The costume was hot and uncomfortable though.

    Being a magician is way more anxiety provoking, and recovering from failed tricks can be a skill and a half. But there's
    something neat about knowing some magic tricks, or just a fascination with illusions in general. Having an understanding
    regarding the relationship between our senses and the experience of observing the world around us</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">May I have a recommendation for a graphic novel? I'd love to get a taste of your interests.

    I'm thoroughly entertained and captivated by your lighthearted and fun expressions in your profile. The picture of your
    cat mooning me is killing rn ♥️</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">you're good, I don't discriminate against picture books! the book that hit me the most that i got them is a nonbinary
    picture book called From the Stars in the Sky to the Fish in the Sea :] Aw that's so sweet, little brothers are the best
    ❤️ & honestly big fan of running in a circle aimlessly sometimes when I get a burst of excitement I need to spin in a
    circle. Do you have any other siblings?</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">I love the way you describe full costume entertainment & kids reacting with joy! I totally relate to the eyes on you but
    not on you, I also get performance anxiety. Not that I do theater or entertainment stuff really, but back in high school
    I did a few plays. I've always felt such sympathy for people in full costume because I've assumed they must be hot
    inside, it's impressive!</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">Oh I can't imagine recovering from a failed trick I think I would just explode on the spot! That's not a skill and a
    half that's like a skill x 10!! I used to be obsessed with watching magic acts on tv talent shows a few years ago, there
    is something about it that charms me wholly. What's your favorite trick?</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">I am always eager to give recommendations!! Hmmmmm...oh this is hard to just pick one! I really love The Montague Twins
    by Nathan Page & Drew Shannon which has both beautiful art & storytelling about twins with magic solving a mystery.
    That's not the best summary but I have a hard time being concise & I'm already taking up so much rambling so that's the
    best I can do! Also Shadow of The Batgirl by Sarah Kuhn holds a special place in my heart because I love comics.</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">Aww, thank you!! 🙈❤️ I'm glad miss Monkey (mooning cat) gave you a laugh! You have a very sweet smile and I love your
    pink frame glasses ❤️</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">I love your full in depth replies. If I don't respond just know it's because sleep has claimed me, I am eager to give
    your messages my undivided attention.

    Another nb book to add to my list! ✨✨✨ My heart, it soars.

    Hahaha zoomies are a shared delight, I would join the circle spin. I have no full blood siblings, and there's a big age
    gap between me and my oldest sibling. I affectionately refer to myself as the highschool mistake, and my mother
    protests. I have two half sisters by my father, one half brother by my mother, and I had two step-sisters though our
    relationship is a question mark at this point with my mom's ~recent divorce. The ages range from 6-17 among my siblings.
    I love them very much and think it's so cool to see them develop thoughts about existing. They go from trying to eat
    dirt as children to successfully eating the dirt because I guess I'm not going to stop them as adolescents 😂

    It's been a good amount of time since I worked in entertainment... (1/?)</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">... but I look fondly back at the memories. I initially found the work because my friend wanted to be a princess and we
    stumbled into entertainment work where she could actually work as a princess.

    Does performance anxiety make the type of activity something to avoid or just less comfortable for you?

    Ooo did you ever see criss angel on tv? I remember being excited about his show. I'm often teased about doing magic
    tricks from time to time 💖 my bestie recently told me it was the most concerning thing about me when we met, which
    feels like a backhanded compliment? All with non-malicious intent of course.

    If you exploded that would be more impressive than any trick I could do. My favorite is one where I have someone write a
    number on a piece of paper, rip it up, burn it, then I can recite the number. I think I'm mostly fond of it because it
    involves fire and that's always a good flare :)

    I enjoy your "rambling" and only want to encourage it. I've actually been... (2/?)</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">in the mood for some new content so this fills my own selfish interests too!! I'm excited to read your recommendations.

    ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ What a great name! Monkey is fantastic, and your happiness next to her is contagious.

    Let me see if I can't find a picture of Aura! You might enjoy her</div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">

    </div>
    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom">This is my mom's / my cat. Was mine before I moved out way back when but she stayed with mom.

    Sleep is claiming me, but I look forward to hearing from you again. Sleep well Finn!</div>
    <div class="bubble grow left">OH MY GOD BEAUTIFUL CAT!!! I LOVE YOU AURA 🥺🥺🥺!! I’m falling asleep too but needed to appreciate kitty first :] good
    night & sweet dreams 🌙 💌</div>

    <p>
      As the universe expected, it did not take long for the silliest goofball to be
      completely enamored with princess garbanzo bean.

      And a first call led to...

    <div class="bubble shadow large bottom"> 
      It might be too short notice, but any chance we could have dinner together
      Wednesday? I’m looking at an Indian food place I think would be near you: 1337 Encinitas Blvd
